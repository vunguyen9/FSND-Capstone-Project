## Motivations & Covered Topics

By completing this project, I learn and apply my skills on : 

1. Database modeling with `postgres` & `sqlalchemy` (see `models.py`)
2. API to performance CRUD Operations on database with `Flask` (see `app.py`)
3. Automated testing with `Unittest` (see `test_app`)
4. Authorization RBAC  with `Auth0` (see `auth.py`)
5. Deployment on `Heroku`

<a name="start-locally"></a>
## Start Project locally

Make sure you `cd` into the correct folder (with all app files) before following the setup steps.
Also, you need the latest version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
and [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed on your machine.

### Pre-requisites and Local Development
Developers using this project should already have Python3, pip and node installed on their local machines.

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.8

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Getting Started

To start and run the local development server

1. Initialize and activate a virtualenv:
  ```bash
  $ virtualenv --no-site-packages env
  $ source env/bin/activate
  ```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Auth0

If you only want to test the API, you can
simply use the existing bearer tokens in `test_app.py`.


4. Run the development server:
  ```bash 
  $ python3 app.py
  ```

5. Testing
To run the tests, run

```bash 
$ python3 test_app.py
```
It should give this response if everything went fine:

```bash
$ python3 test_app.py

## API Reference
<a name="api"></a>

### Deployment

- Base URL: **_https://vn-capstone.herokuapp.com_**


### EndPoints

1. Actors
   1. [GET /actors](#get-actors)
   2. [POST /actors](#post-actors)
   3. [DELETE /actors](#delete-actors)
   4. [PATCH /actors](#patch-actors)
2. Movies
   1. [GET /movies](#get-movies)
   2. [POST /movies](#post-movies)
   3. [DELETE /movies](#delete-movies)
   4. [PATCH /movies](#patch-movies)

You can use access_token in for each role in `test_app.py`

### Roles

- Casting Assistant
  - Can view actors and movies
- Casting Director
  - All permissions a Casting Assistant has and…
  - Add or delete an actor from the database
  - Modify actors or movies
- Executive Producer
  - All permissions a Casting Director has and…
  - Add or delete a movie from the database


### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
  "success": False,
  "error": 400,
  "message": "bad request"
}
```

- Authorization Error
```
{
  'code': 'invalid_header',
  'description': 'Authorization header must be bearer token'
}
```

The API will return three error types when requests fail:
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 422: Unprocessable
- 401: invalid_header
